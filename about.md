I'm a staff-level data scientist based in rural North Yorkshire in the United Kingdom. I've spent the last 15 years or so working in tech, most recently at Automattic (previously at Spotify, SkyScanner, Arachnys, The Hut Group, Mars).

I'm also pursuing a part-time DPhil in Social Data Science at Oxford, researching how digital environments shape human behaviour through habit formation. 

On top of that, I'm married and have ~2~ 3 small children. 

All of that generally means I'm pretty busy.
