I'm a data scientist based in Yorkshire, working on subscription analytics and user behaviour modelling. I'm also pursuing a part-time DPhil in Social Data Science at Oxford, researching how digital environments shape human behaviour through habit formation.

When I'm not wrangling data or reading papers, I'm probably spending time with my family, working on a novel, or tinkering with something that seemed like a good idea at the time.
