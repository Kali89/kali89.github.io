It's going to look like I spend a lot of my time doing events and supporting my
children in their interests and things like that and I worry that I might be
giving you the wrong impression. However, today, we took the park and ride into
York and attended a battle for 5 - 12 year olds in honour of York's viking
festival.<!--more-->

## Battle Mode

The event was great. Probably about 100 kids equipped with foam swords, shields
and helmets allowed to beat the shit out of each other and taught the basics of
a shield wall. Obviously, the six-year-old loved it and has spent the
afternoon/evening practicing his *"moves"*. The four-year-old was sad that she
didn't get to partake, but was cheered up immensely by the opportunity to buy a
cuddly warhammer. 

A cuddly warhammer. 

Cuddly. Warhammer.

## Lazy Days

The day before, we were back from holiday and basically mooched around the
house the whole day. There's nothing that brings me greater joy than a good
mooch, with the children playing with each other (we played 'toilet tig' which
I'd have called 'tiggy bump' or 'tiggy bop down' - though you apparently have
to flush the toilet to free the contender) and generally ticking off life
admin. Two loads of washing, a bunch of tidying up, and a happy family. Bliss.

## Injury

I also managed to get to the gym, but I think I probably overdid it and have
been skirting illness all day. No idea what it is - it's possibly
diverticulitis but that seems pretty unlikely. I have that, but I don't really
see why that'd be exacerbated by gym. Maybe it isn't exacerbated by the gym,
but by travelling (we drove back from Scotland), living unhealthily (we were in
Scotland), or by something else entirely.

Like all people, I'd love to ascribe some sort of reason...because then I could
do something about it and retake the power. But for now, I can't, and so I'm on
liquid diets and resting and trying to parent as much as possible without
hurting myself.

## Conclusion

Why do I need a conclusion for every post? Well, this is just a slice-of-life:
a reminder to myself on what I've done. I watched my six-year-old charge at a
full grown man with beard, battle axe and flag and try to push him over. The
three-year-old would have been scared of strangers and would have hidden behind
my legs. It's good to remind myself of that.

Also, go to the Viking Festival. York is pretty accessible and pretty cool.
