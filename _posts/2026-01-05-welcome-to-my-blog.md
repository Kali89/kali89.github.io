This is my first blog post. I've set up this site using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, which means I can write posts in Markdown and they'll automatically be converted into a nice-looking website.

## Why Blog?

I've been meaning to start writing more publicly for a while. Having a space to share thoughts on data science, research, and whatever else catches my interest seems like a good idea.

## What You'll Find Here

I expect to write about:

- Data science and analytics
- Machine learning and statistical modelling
- Research methodology
- Occasionally, other things

## A Code Example

Since I'll probably be sharing code, here's what that looks like:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def calculate_retention(cohort_data):
    """Calculate retention rates for a cohort."""
    initial_users = cohort_data.iloc[0]
    retention = cohort_data / initial_users
    return retention
```

Looking forward to writing more soon.
