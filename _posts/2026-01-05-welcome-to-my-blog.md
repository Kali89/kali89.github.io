Hello! 

Every year I feel a calling to do *something* in much the same way
everybody does. But what exactly is *something*? Well, a few times over the
last few weeks I've thought it probably makes sense to start a blog and
finally, my reasons for not having a blog have become outweighed by my reasons
for having one. Let's take a quick whirlwind tour over why I think I should
have a blog...

## Why Blog?

1. I (approximately) work for WordPress.com - that means I have a vested
   interest in blogging and in understanding the kinds of things bloggers care about. 
2. An increasing proportion of the 'content' I consume comes from personal
   blogs. All the cool people are sharing thoughts via their blogs. Shouldn't I be a cool person?
3. I have been explicitly told to [create a blog](https://wordpress.com/blog/2025/12/11/why-you-should-start-a-blog/) by my CEO, and given budget and
   time to do so.
4. In a world of AI slop and generated content, I don't know exactly what you
   can do except contribute original not-AI-generated content. I mean, there's
probably lots you can do, but this is what I'm doing.
5. I have children. It'd be nice to be able to show them *something* at some
   point about what I thought about.

OK, so that's at least some of the thoughts. 

I'm hoping to make this quick a lightweight. I don't need to stake my professional reputation on every post. I
don't need to make everything a big deal. Sometimes I'll just share a photo or
a quick thought. Sometimes I'll write an essay. Whatever.
