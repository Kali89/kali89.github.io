I just spent a week living in an AirBnb with 4 of my colleagues. We went to the
supermarket together, cooked breakfast together, visited museums, went out
to the pub...all the things you (well, I) do on a holiday. But it was with 4
people who fate (or, my employer) had thrown together. <!--more-->

## Building Culture and Trust

With the whole COVID-shift-to-remote thing, a bunch of companies (and,
primarily, employees) discovered the benefits of remote work. However, they
also discovered one of the drawbacks - the difficulty in building a coherent
team culture. In bonding. In forming relationships with your team.

Some enlightened companies are trying to have their cake and eat
it - Spotify have "core weeks" where all employees are required to be in an
office. However, a large number of (tech) companies are now either requiring a
full RTO (return-to-office) or have office-based mandates, stating the number
of days you have to be present in order to fulfill your
"culture-and-team-building" requirements.

### RTO Mandates

Now I want to be reasonable. Forcing people to sit near to each other day-on-day is clearly a way of
achieving a coherent culture and team-building. Maybe you're somebody for whom that's not true but, if you look
at schools and Universities and work and...well, everywhere...when you put a
bunch of people next to each other for long periods of time, they seem to be
pretty good at creating little tribes.

And little tribes who all like/respect each other and can work together
harmoniously and achieve greater than the sum of their parts and all of that
jazz sounds like music to executive-ears.

### Another Way

I've worked somewhat remotely for around 7 of the last 15 years and have done
so in a bunch of different situations (only remote employee at a startup, one of a few
remotes, everybody remote, everybody remote and async) and I agree
wholeheartedly that in-person meeting supercharges team-building.

However, I've found that the bit **after** the off-site/meetup where you all go to a restaurant/bar/pub/ski
chalet/AirBnb is by-far-and-away the part where most of the team building
happens.

You sit in a conference room/meeting all day talking about strategy or running
a retro or doing whatever you have to do to look like you're working. And then,
you get the benefit of spending time with other people and do all that lovely
team-forming that you're really there to do.

What if...well, what if you just did the best bit?

## Meetups/Time in Person

My part-time DPhil technically requires 30 days/year in Oxford, or 1 day per
term. My strong advice to the University was that 1 day per week is probably
the worst possible way of achieving 30 days/year. With 1 day per week, I'm
travelling early, fulfilling my requirement, and then getting out of the office
as quickly as possible to start a gruelling commute back home. Yuck. I'm sad, I
don't spend much time with my colleagues, and any time I do spend is rushed
tired and grumpy time.

Instead, I spend up to a week in a single visit. I'm relaxed, rested, and am
delighted to meetup at breakfast, take a pleasant lunch with people, and then
have dinner/drinks with somebody else. I live and breathe in the city and its
culture. I'm there less often, but the hours I'm there, I make it count.

My current employer (Automattic, a fully remote company since 2005) take an extreme approach to this very problem. Rather than offices, office hours or any of the usual approaches, they instead have a culture of meetups. Rather than the monotonous breathless grind of painful commute-filled weeks and watercooler chat, I spend a couple of very intense weeks (over a year) with my colleagues where we live
in each others pockets. I think each one of those weeks **comfortably** builds
culture more effectively than the 'sit-next-to-people' osmosis style approach
that appears to currently be favoured.

## What a Week looks like

You plan the week together - generally one person takes lead but they **must**
be respectful of everybody else's circumstances. If somebody can't travel to a
specific country, or they get the ick at the idea of sharing a house, or they
have to be able to call home at a specific time each day...well, you wouldn't
plan a holiday that objectively doesn't work for one of the attendees...so we
have to be mindful of our group's circumstances.

Choosing a location, accommodation, food, activities...these all reveal people's
preferences and help you get to know people. Then you travel and meet the
avatars come-to-life, and get to laugh at how tall everybody is, or what they
look like without headphones, or whether their shoes are especially outrageous.

Put smart people with a shared interest together, and you'll be surprised at
when the 'value' turns up. We had a group presentation one night at midnight
because we were all feeling it. We didn't start one day until midday because we
fancied a walk to a coffee shop. On the walk, we discussed team structure and
agreed on a plan forward. Our agenda was created on the first day and never
looked at again, because we didn't need it.

Work bleeds into the personal and personal bleeds into the work, and you end up
spending the week in whatever way makes sense. No strict agenda and no
checklists...just smart people working out how best to live and work together.
Arguments about company culture over starters, and cool card tricks during the
planning sessions.

### Downsides

There are downsides to the approach I'm espousing. It can make things difficult
familially (I have three small children - my wife has to perform heroics while
I'm off working) or for anybody with caring responsibilities. It costs more
money (assuming your employer covers travel and accommodation costs, but
wouldn't cover commuting costs). And it's exhausting.

This approach also doesn't guarantee anything. You're taking smart grown-ups
and you're putting them together and *hoping* something good happens. It's the
organisational equivalent of jazz - maybe the horn and the bass just don't gel
and spend the song clashing rather than harmonising.

But ultimately, if you're in a band together - you have to find a way to make
it work. Perhaps the horn and the bass *need* to clash, until they find their
rhythm.

## Conclusion

Working remotely is great - when it works well it can be incredible from a
personal perspective (nobody likes commuting), an organisational perspective
(deep-work is much easier when you can choose where to work), and a national
perspective (imagine not having all jobs located in one place!).

But it's hard to build a culture when your employees never see each other and
never get the chance to talk without an agenda.

I went on holiday with my colleagues, and it was the best team-building I've
done since I last went away on holiday with them.
