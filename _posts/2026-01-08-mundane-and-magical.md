I have three small children - currently a 6 year old, a 3 year old and a 6
month old. They're all the things small children are supposed to be.

I wanted to share a brief snapshot in time of why I think parenting is amazing. <!--more-->It's a fleeting moment - the kind that I'll
forget about and just imbue into the overall 'fabric' of being a parent. That's
why I want to write this down, and part of the reason I'm doing this blog. I
don't want to forget the magical moments that'll ultimately fade into the
mundanity of everyday life.

Yesterday, my eldest boy burst through the front door after school and before I
could even ask him *"how was school?"* he launched into a breathless monologue
about Samuel Pepys and the Great Fire of London and the fact that Samuel
Pepys's diary had been written in a code that his own mother couldn't decipher.

He was so excited, and even moreso when he found out that I didn't know about
the code and that he was actively teaching me something. The sheer joy. The
wonder. Over a typical day at school.

And then later in the evening I mentioned that I was having somebody come and
value the house. He was angry, and, as all good six year olds would,
threatened to shoot our car with an arrow if I sold our house. He told me that
*"you can only sell the house if it is good for the whole family"*.

I told him to calm down, and that *"only doing things that are good for the
whole family"* is the main job of being a dad. My wife pitched in and said
*"Daddy always does what's best for the family, because he loves us all."*

My son burst into tears, and flapped at my wife saying *"Happy tears"*. 

He was crying because he loved his dad so much and was so happy that his dad
always did what was best for the family.

Parenting is 95% mundanity and grind, but in every day, if you're paying attention, there's magic. Magic that
you couldn't achieve in a thousand years any other way.
