No great revelations today, but I just wanted to keep up the habit of
writing. I'm sick today - nothing major, just a cold or something. I hurt my
finger wrestling my eldest son last night. This morning I thought it was
broken, but it's gotten steadily better over the day. <!--more-->

## Health

I pay for health insurance (or at least I pay the tax on it) - I've not had to
use it much but I'm reminded of a quotation I heard sometime ago:

> You can have 99 problems, until you're sick. Then you only have one problem.

I don't know quite about the specifics (and maybe I've butchered it), but
feeling sick is rubbish and does kind of eclipse any other problems you might
think you have.

## Claude Code

I've also been tentatively dipping my foot into pure vibe-coding with Claude
Code. It's really very good. Frighteningly good. The kind of good that makes
me think that all these people espousing the change of the working world
might not be making things up. This...well, it's good. But I'm sick, so I
think it's good in a scary and bad way.

Maybe I'll think it's magical when I'm better.

## House Viewing

I went to look at a house yesterday. We're not really house hunting, but the
opportunity to view Lewis Carroll's old house came up and I reasoned I should
take it. It's a cool house, but my wife wasn't sold. It would have been a
bunch of work, and when you're sick, a bunch of work is roughly the last
thing you want.

As I think you can tell, being sick is clouding pretty much everything.

Hopefully I get better soon!
