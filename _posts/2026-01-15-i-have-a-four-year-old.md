Happy Birthday! Not today, but at some point over the last few days I went from
having an impossible and impossibly cute three-year old to having a...well, an
impossible and impossibly cute four-year old.

If you're wondering what kind of life-goals a newly minted four-year old has,
then check this out: <!--more-->

A list of the things she wants to do when she's four. For those who struggle
with my wife's handwriting those things are:

1. Turn the TV on by herself
2. Swimming lessons
3. Go camping with a tent
4. (Learn to ride a) Pedal bike
5. Learn writing
6. Open more presents on this day (she means today) 

You'll be glad to know that she achieved one of those on the day of her
birthday, and I'm confident that she'll be able to manage at least 5 of those
in the coming year. 

"Learn writing" is the tricky one - I told her that I don't know that we have
ever really "learned writing". She gazed wistfully at me and said "how profound
daddy. I suppose you're right."

Now obviously, I've made that up and instead we're going to spend a fun year
learning how to write letters. 

At the moment, she loves tracing out letters if we do the dots and is only confident with 1s and 0s (which, if you're a binary calculating machine, are all you need for letters anyway). 

Anyway, enough of that nonsense. I'm excited for the year ahead and to watch you achieve your goals for the year!
