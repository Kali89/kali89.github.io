A very brief story for today, but it's another cute one.

My wife got an 'injury' form today at the nursery pick-up - our three year old
girl had had a bump on the head. No biggie - it's the sort of thing that
happens fairly regularly.

When she told us about it (eventually, after watching Peppa Pig) she said that
one of the older girls had hit her in the head with a cone. And that she'd
cried. And then her older brother had cried.

We pushed her on this, and it turns out that she'd gotten hurt and her older
brother had come over and given her a hug and the pair of them cried together
on the playground until it was all better.

Needless to say, I sat down with eldest child and told him how proud of him I
was for helping out his little sister when she needed it.

One of the unexpected benefits of more than one children is that their
relationship with each other is a joy to behold. Sure, they fall out a lot. But
watching them love each other is a strange kind of double joy. To see them
love, and to see them be loved is incredible. To see it twice over is...well,
I'm glad we decided to have multiple children.
