Yesterday morning I chased two horses. Today, it's been exactly the sort of slow Sunday that a life is made of. Some days are
full of activity and action and milestones but others are just normal. <!--more-->

Yesterday morning, while wandering through the village trying to get the baby to
sleep, I saw two horses on the road without anybody around. I ran after them,
and fortunately was joined by their owner. I briefly held onto one, and fed
both of them bread. 

Today there was a little snow on the ground in
the morning, but it quickly disappeared given a day of heavy driving rain, and
so we spent the day inside, tidying and playing board games and doing homework
and colouring and having a fire. 

That actually sounds pretty idyllic and maybe it was - it didn't feel like it
at the time. It just felt like a normal day where we achieved some small
things, but mostly we took up our time just with ordinary living.

"Life is what happens when you're busy making plans" or something like that,
right?

In all honesty, I love weekends at home with the family. There's usually at
least some difficulty, but if we can get out into the garden and tramp around a
bit, or go on a walk or just bathe (sometimes stew) in each other's company... I
don't know. Maybe I'll regret not doing lots of plans and activities and things
like that in the future.

But maybe I'll be glad that I wallowed in my family - that I spent regular deep
time with them.

Maybe I shouldn't optimise so heavily for what I'll regret (or not) in the
future - is a future version of me looking back at current me really a better
judge of what I should be doing? Or even worse, current me imagining future me
looking back at me. 

I'm confident future me will say I should have gone jogging every day or
something like that... but that's fine for future me to say. Future me isn't the
one who has to do it.

Anyway, that's not the point. It was a nice, warm, uneventful sort of day that
looked a lot like this:

It's hard to complain too much about a day that starts like this, isn't it?
