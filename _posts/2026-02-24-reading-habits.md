I finished a book last night, and it was a good one! ***The Final Empire*** by
Brandon Sanderson - found via an Amazon deal (I'd never read any of his stuff
before, though I'd heard of him plenty).<!--more--> I managed to pick up the
whole trilogy for 99p or something absurd like that, and I can't wait to get on
with the next book in the series...

## Reading Habits

I read every night, with very very few exceptions. If I made an exception for
extreme tiredness or illness, with a 7 month old, I'd never get round to it.
Ever since I was a teenager, I've had a 'bedtime book' and generally spend at least 30 minutes a night reading it. I didn't realise that this was probably unusual until much later on in life, but it's so ingrained that I never really consider it any more.

Sometimes, the book I'm reading is a bit of a slog and maybe I'll only get
through a chapter or so. Last night, reaching the end of a very thrilling
fantasy book, I ended up spending at least an hour.

I generally try to mix up my choice of book, so if I've just finished something
"heavy" and "classic" then I'll go to something a little bit easier and more
fun. I'm thinking of this now because I finished Les Miserables a week or two
ago and found it a bit of a slog. I jumped straight into Wee Free Men and found
that lovely and charming, and then onto Brandon Sanderson. Now because it's a
trilogy, I'm probably just going to keep reading it. I'm not prescriptive about
switching around - especially if I'm into something.

## How to Build a Reading Habit

Given my DPhil, I'm interested in the habit and how it formed and where it
lives and all that jazz. I read something interesting last year on the way to
build bright children - it was on some essay competition and it was somebody's
experience with a wholly-online AI-driven (isn't everything?) school. It made a
bunch of good arguments, but essentially the school sees fantastic results by
paying students.

Some people might bristle against the idea of paying people for
studying...shouldn't children be intrinsically motivated? Aren't all the most
successful people motivated by love of the craft?

The article argued that yes...they are...now. It said that people's motivations
change over time, and the people who end up being world class are able to
transition between motivation types as they age, to continue developing their
skills in a given area.

## Motivation Over Time

When we're young, we're motivated by parental approval and rewards. My children
want TV time, sweets and chocolate, and mummy and daddy to be proud of them. I
don't think that's a moral failing. It's being 6. So we praise the behaviour we
want, and encourage them with rewards.

At some point, parental approval becomes basically worthless and peer approval
becomes the be all and end all. This is where I spend a lot of time worrying
about schools and peer groups, because as a parent, you lose a huge deal of
control and influence and surrender it to your children's classmates. It's a
lot to ask of a teenager to ignore peer pressure and become a social pariah in
order to keep up their dream of being an ice dancer.

Finally, as we become adult we become self-motivated: driven by aiming to be
the best version of ourselves, and loving the craft for what it is.

Now clearly, everything isn't quite so linear - there are plenty of adults who
still desperately need validation from their peers or their parents (I'm not
immune to this myself!), but viewed generally, I think this makes sense.

### Paying Children to Read

This brings me to one particular way of building a reading habit. I'm arguing
here that you shouldn't feel bad about paying your child to read. My parents
often pay my children to read and at first I was uncomfortable with it, but
I've made my peace with it.

One summer when I was learning guitar, my dad offered me £5 for each of his
favourite songs that I learned all the way through. I was already incredibly
motivated (partially internally, but in much larger part through my peer-group)
but it definitely helped me focus.

## Why I Read

I no longer think about reading - I don't have to motivate myself to do so, I
just do it. However, when I choose my books I tend to mix enjoyment with
betterment. System 1 and System 2. I want to be entertained, but I also want to
be the best possible version of myself. When I'm old, I want to be wise. Not
simply clever, but wise.

## Conclusion

I read a book, but then pontificated on that for a while. We touched on the
various forms of motivation, and how you can create a virtuous habit in
children. And where key points of friction for that habit are. I told you why I
read. And I told you what I read. What more conclusion could you hope for than
that?
