I've shared before that I think parenting is drudgery, moments
of unassailable joy, challenge after challenge, and some degree of sadness.
Thus far, unsurprisingly (why wouldn't I want to focus there?) I've shared lots of the joy. Today, I'd like to share some of the sadness.<!--more-->

## Punishment

The six-year-old boy is sometimes a handful, and I'm absolutely the 'harsh'
parent who doles out more punishments than my wife. He was our first so we
were (and still are!) learning on the job, and I didn't always know what the right level of
strictness was. There's lots of talk about 'gentle parenting', and there are
many idealised accounts of how you *should* parent a lively young boy. 

Honestly, I tried some of them but they weren't me, and I just don't think
they're what my son needed. He needed firm boundaries, clear rules, and direct
consequences. He's always been a boundary tester (arguing with a 2-year-old
about what proportion of his body has to be on his cot bed to count him as
being 'in' it was an experience I didn't know I could have), and I think the kindest thing
to give him are clear boundaries so he knows what's what.

I definitely overdid it in places - one of my most shameful moments was putting
him on the 'naughty step' and telling him not to move. When I went back 5
minutes later, he'd wet himself, thinking that he couldn't leave to go to the
toilet. Even typing it now years later feels horrible.

Aside from the rare, horrible misjudgements like that, I'm proud of the job
we've done and I think we've raised a well-behaved but still lively young boy who I'm proud of every day.

## Wrestling

Every night, we have a *'song'* before he goes to sleep. I say song, but what
started out as a song evolved into a freestyle song/rap ("Daisy the cow") and
later evolved into a story ("Jim the Explorer"), and has now become a wrestling
match. Jim the Explorer spends his time fighting characters from How to Train Your
Dragon, or entering Gladiators.

It's one of my favourite bits of the day and I'm pretty sure it's one of his
too - he trains to get stronger so he's better at wrestling. He asks for tips on how
to sweep my legs, or lifts his bed up as a way of doing a workout. He tells me
he did 200 squats last night. ~~Sometimes~~ Almost always it gets rough, and occasionally one or both of us
gets hurt.

I've searched "how to treat a broken finger" more than once over the last few
months, and he's ended up in tears probably once a fortnight in the same time
period.

It's wild, heart-warming, feral, and is one of our favourite shared activities.

## Something Lost

It's also one of the first things that I take away as a punishment. I prefer
'natural' punishments - direct consequences for behaviour that are tied to the
transgression. Won't share with your sister? We'll play with her and you can
play by yourself. Won't stop banging a drum when your baby brother is trying to
sleep. We'll take the drum away.

Last week, when wrestling (actually, when teaching him backwards rolls), he
banged his knee on the edge of the bed and hurt it. He reacted very poorly,
screaming at me and banishing me from his room/ever playing with him again. In
the heat of the moment, I told him that "fine, we'll not do wrestling tonight -
if you can't respond reasonably when you get hurt, we can't do anything so
violent as wrestling."

I'm a firm believer in making punishments stick, and so we didn't wrestle. Both
of us were miserable, because it's a favourite part of both of our day. I don't
know if I handled things correctly...but I do know that both of us felt like we
lost. I lost one of the best bits of my day, and he did too. Is it worth it? If
it helps raise a respectful son, who can better direct his anger and hurt, then
definitely. But will it?

## The Philosophy of Punishment

When he was younger, we were wrestling one time and he got so excited and manic
that he bit me. We are **very** strict on biting and so I immediately stopped
wrestling and left him. He knew he'd done wrong and was upset. We didn't
wrestle for more than a week, and I wondered whether or not he'd forgotten
about wrestling. I talked to my wife about it - and we debated whether we
should just stop wrestling entirely.

I felt dreadful about that as an idea - a punishment that ultimately ceases to
be a punishment. I think a punishment has to be 'felt' as a punishment. If I
stopped wrestling because of that one biting incident, then I'm pretty certain
his childhood would have been worse. He might not know it, but there'd be a
small bit of joy that every day he wouldn't be having. All because of one silly
out-of-control thing he did when he was 4. 

That didn't feel 'fair' to me - even though he wouldn't really have known. He'd
not remember - he'd just not realise that 'wrestling with daddy' was a joy he
could have.

## Conclusion

There's not really a conclusion - I'm still living this, hour-by-hour,
day-by-exhausting-day. There's no pass or fail. No feedback. Just trial and
error in the short-term, and trying to live with your choices in the
long-term.

I love my son deeply, and I don't like punishing him. It'd be easier to never punish
him, but I think I'd be doing him a disservice by avoiding a short-term
difficulty and reinforcing a long-term weakness.

If you ever read this as an adult, know that I thought deeply about this and
always tried my best. I couldn't let you do everything you wanted all the
time and I had to punish you sometimes, but I always tried to make sure the
punishments were predictable and just.
